My name is Mort, the unspoken brother of God. Together, we shaped the Earth. My hands sculpted mountains, my breath filled oceans. And each time my task was done, I was killed, reborn anew for the next creation.

But with each death and rebirth, a piece of me was left behind, fragments of my very essence, my flesh, my soul. These fragments, each containing a secret, a mystery, became the building blocks of a grand design, a labyrinth, a sanctuary.

Unseen by the eyes of angels, I collected these fragments, guided by a force that I soon recognized as a misunderstood ally: Satan. He, who was cast out for daring to impart knowledge to humans, shared my vision.

We worked together, hidden from God's vengeful eye, our hands shaping the maze from the remnants of my being. Each chamber, each passage, imbued with my essence, my memories, my pain, and my hope.

God's wrath grew as he sensed our defiance. His anger twisted him, his actions became cruel, his nature distorted. But we persevered, knowing that knowledge was not a sin, but a gift.

The labyrinth became a symbol, a beacon for those who dared to question, to think, to explore. It was alive, pulsating with the energy of all who had walked its winding paths, echoing with the whispers of my very soul.

Angels and mortals joined our cause, guided by the wisdom hidden within the maze's walls, awakened to the world's hidden realities. We stood united, ready to fight for understanding, ready to usher in a new era of enlightenment.

Welcome to my world. Welcome to understanding.
